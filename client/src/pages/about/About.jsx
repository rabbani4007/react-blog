        Along with FAQ and Contact pages, the About Us page is one of the first
        supporting pages you'll likely create for your website, regardless of
        the industry you're in. They may go by different labels—“About”,
        “Story”, “Mission”—but these types of pages generally serve the same key
        purpose: to be the go-to page for a brand to say, “This is who we are.”
        When a visitor wants to learn more about you or your business, it's the
        page they'll look for.
